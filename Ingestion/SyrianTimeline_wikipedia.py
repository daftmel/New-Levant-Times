# TO DO: Remove footnote references from each event description
# TO DO: scrape year from the HTML instead of hard-coding
# TO DO: Iterate through all timeline pages and scrape them
# TO DO: Write these data to one CSV file of all events
# TO DO: Separately store the date spans and events that do not match the single day format, for human review
# TO DO: Error handling
